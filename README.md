# Worthless Carebears Onboarding Documentation

**Welcome to Eve’s Worthless Care bears \[WCBR\]. Why you choose to join us is certainly bound to be an interesting tale, full of blackmail, threats and misinformation. You’re here now though and that’s all water under the bridge, or so you’re sponsor informed me. Please do remember during this on boarding process that we know where your family lives.**

## **Who We Are**

**WCBR is an industrial PVP corporation occupying mid to north Deklein primarily based out of the system, N-TFXK. At the time of this writing WCBR also possesses assets in, and rights to operate in, DKUK-G and 33RB-0.

**As an industrial corp WCBR engages in a lot of industry, mining, planetary production, and manufacturing; all industrial operations are encouraged and supported. WCBR Carebears co-operate on all of this which has given WCBR the capacity to become a major supplier of capital ships in the region.**

**As a PVP corporation WCBR offers Carebears the ability to spontaneously drop exorbitantly expensive assets on relatively low priority targets. This is called salt farming and is one of the benefits offered by the corporation.**

**It is important to note the casual attitude of the corporation. Carebears are friendly however the conversation occasionally requires a thick skin. That said, respect for peers is still a requirement for all Carebears.**
