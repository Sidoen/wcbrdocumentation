**As an industrial corp WCBR engages in a lot of industry, mining, planetary production, and manufacturing; all industrial operations are encouraged and supported. WCBR Carebears co-operate on all of this which has given WCBR the capacity to become a major supplier of capital ships in the region.**

**As a PVP corporation WCBR offers Carebears the ability to spontaneously drop exorbitantly expensive assets on relatively low priority targets. This is called salt farming and is one of the benefits offered by the corporation.**

**It is important to note the casual attitude of the corporation. Carebears are friendly however the conversation occasionally requires a thick skin. That said, respect for peers is still a requirement for all Carebears.**
