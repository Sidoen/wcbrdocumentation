# Onboarding

Welcome to Eve’s Worthless Carebears \[WCBR\]. Why you choose to join us is certainly bound to be an interesting tale, full of blackmail, threats and misinformation. You’re here now though and that’s all water under the bridge, or so you’re sponsor informed me. Please do remember during this onboarding process that we know where your family lives.

TODO: Needs updating
{% endhint %}

## Who we Are

WCBR is an industrial PVP corporation occupying mid to north Deklein primarily based out of the system, N-TFXK. At the time of this writing WCBR also possesses assets in, and rights to operate in, DKUK-G and 33RB-0.  
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Deklein/N-TFXK

As an industrial corp WCBR engages in a lot of industry, mining, planetary production, and manufacturing; all industrial operations are encouraged and supported. WCBR Carebears co-operate on all of this which has given WCBR the capacity to become a major supplier of capital ships in the region.

As a PVP corporation WCBR offers Carebears the ability to spontaneously drop exorbitantly expensive assets on relatively low priority targets. This is called salt farming and is one of the benefits offered by the corporation.

It is important to note the casual attitude of the corporation. Carebears are friendly however the conversation occasionally requires a thick skin. That said, respect for peers is still a requirement for all Carebears.

## Alliance and Coalition Relationships

WCBR is a member of the alliance Solyaris Chtonium \[SLYCE\]. SLYCE occupies Deklein with its headquarters located in TXME-A. Consult the following DOTLAN map for the current systems in which SLYCE holds sovereignty.  
[http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Deklein\#sov](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Deklein#sov)SLYCE itself is a member of the coalition Guardians of the Galaxy \[GOTG\]. GOTG stages fleets from various locations in the north. Coalition borders change frequently, though a good approximation of GOTG space can be viewed on the following site.  
[http://sov.space/](http://sov.space/)

## Corporation Services

The Corporation offers several services and tools to improve coordination and logistics and improve quality of life in nullsec space.

### Loot Boxes

Every Carebear may request a loot box in N-TFXK. This container can be found under the corporate hangar “Loot Boxes”. Whatever you put into this container is purchased at 90% of Jita estimated value by the corporation.

### Carebear Freight

The corporation offers a freighter service running to and from Jita. To use this service create a courier contract and assign it to the corporation at the corporate rate. Carebear pilots will pick up these contracts and ship them. Freight runs do not operate on a schedule but contracts typically take up to three days to complete.

Rates and conditions for this service can be found on the Corporation Bulletin. Consult the “Corporate Bulletin \(and other information\)\*” section for information on locating and opening the corporate bulletin.

### Moon Mining Operations

WCBR owns and operates several Moons in and around the corporate systems. These Moons are set on timers which trigger valuable asteroid fields which the corporation collects as a group.

Mining operations in these fields differ from other operations on account of the mining ledger and the fact that these fields are owned and tracked by the Corporation. All ore mined from these fields must go to the Corporation. As the Corporation ledger tracks all of the extracted ore the corp can make payouts as appropriate after the operation is done without additional paperwork.

These operations are often quite large; as a consequence the corporation prepares significant fire support in system to protect Carebear assets.

### Ratting Channels

Ratting is a common practice amongst Carebears. In order to optimize ratting efforts and avoid ships warping to the same signatures, channels have been established for each system. These are secured channels, currently shared with TAOE, whose names and passwords can be found in the corp bulletin and the corp chat’s MOTD.

Ratting Carebears should join these channels to coordinate use of signatures.

## Required and Optional Software

Completion of the on-boarding tasks requires the installation and use of various programs.

Required programs are noted with an asterisk\(\*\).

1. Teamspeak3\* \[TS3\]
2. Discord\*
3. Trello
4. Slack\*
5. N.E.A.R.2

These services are used for real time communication as well as general organization at the corporate, alliance, coalition levels and all of them are necessary.
